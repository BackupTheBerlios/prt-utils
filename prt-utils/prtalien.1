.SH NAME
\fBprtalien \fP- identifies files not installed by CRUX packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBprtalien\fP [\fIpath\fP] [\fIexpression\fP]
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBprtalien\fP is a simple script to identify files on a CRUX Linux system
that don't have an entry in the port tree. (by comparison with
the .footprint files). The tool is mainly intended to track down
files left from manual installations, temporary tests, etc. and
as a valid help for keeping your CRUX installation as clean as possible.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
-a
consider all ports in the tree (not only the installed ones)
as sources for non-alien files.
.TP
.B
[\fIpath\fP] [\fIexpression\fP]
Limit the analysis to a certain \fIpath\fP and
\fIexpression\fP.
These are the same options used by the \fBfind\fP(1) command. (and actually
simply passed to find itself)
.SH EXAMPLES
\fBprtalien\fP /usr/bin
.PP
will print a list of files from /usr/bin that do not
come from the currently installed packages
.PP
\fBprtalien\fP -a /usr/lib -name *.gif
.PP
will print a list of gif files in /usr/lib that
are not present in the entire port tree (installed
and not installed packages)
.PP
You may want to redirect errors to /dev/null to avoid
reporting of missing .footprints files or orphan installed packages
.SH CONFIGURATION
So far the /etc/prtalien.conf is a simple list of
regular expressions of items you don't want to be reported
as alien items. Tipical values are home directories, kernel
images, the /tmp directory content, etc.
Please refer to the prtalien.conf file included in the
package to see some sample.
